Vantiv eCommerce PHP SDK
=====================
#### WARNING:
##### All major version changes require recertification to the new version. Once certified for the use of a new version, Vantiv modifies your Merchant Profile, allowing you to submit transaction to the Production Environment using the new version. Updating your code without recertification and modification of your Merchant Profile will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.

--------------
Up to date list available at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/litle/payments-sdk)

Setup
============
Using with composer
--------------------
If you are using a composer to manage your dependencies, you can do the following in your project directory:

1) Install the composer using command:
> curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

2) Install dependencies using the command:
> php composer.phar install

3) Configure the SDK:
> cd cnp/sdk
> php Setup.php

4) Run the attached sample:
```php
<?php
require_once _DIR_.'/vendor/autoload.php';
#sale
$sale_info = array(
             'orderId' => '1',
             'amount'  => '10010',
             'orderSource' => 'ecommerce',
             'billToAddress' => array(
             'name' => 'John Smith' ,
             'addressLine1' => ' 1 Main St.',
             'city' => 'Burlington' ,
             'state' => 'MA' ,
             'zip' => '0183-3747',
             'country' => 'US'),
             'card' => array(
             'number' => '5112010000000003',
             'expDate' => '0112',
             'cardValidationNum' => '349',
             'type' => 'MC' )
            );
$initialize = new cnp\sdk\CnpOnlineRequest();
$saleResponse =$initialize->saleRequest($sale_info);
#display results
echo ("Response: " . (cnp\sdk\XmlParser::getNode($saleResponse,'response')) . "<br>");
echo ("Message: " . cnp\sdk\XmlParser::getNode($saleResponse,'message') . "<br>");
echo ("Vantiv eCommerce Transaction ID: " . cnp\sdk\XmlParser::getNode($saleResponse,'cnpTxnId'));
```
> php your_sample_name

Using without composer
-----------------------
If you're not, you have to add a require for each and every class that's going to be used.

1) Configure the SDK
> cd into cnp/sdk
> php Setup.php

2) Add the cnp folder and require the path for your file

3) run your file 

> php your_file

Clone Repo
---------------

1) Install the Vantiv eCommerce PHP SDK from git. 

> git clone git://github.com/Vantiv/cnp-sdk-for-php.git

> php ~/composer.phar install


2) Once the SDK is downloaded run our setup program to generate a configuration file.

> cd cnp-sdk-for-php/lib

> php Setup.php

Running the above commands will create a configuration file in the lib directory. 


3) Create a symlink to the SDK

>ln -s /path/to/sdk /var/www/html/nameOfLink


4.) Create a php file similar to: 

```php
<?php
require_once realpath(dirname(__FILE__)) . '/../lib/CnpOnline.php';  
    // Visa $10.00 sale
    $hash_in = array(
	      'amount'=>'106',
	      'orderId' => '123213',
	      'orderSource'=>'ecommerce',
	      'card'=>array(
	      'type'=>'VI',
	      'number' =>'4100000000000001',
	     'expDate' =>'1000')
	      );
//Perform the transaction on the Vantiv eCommerce Platform
$initialize = new CnpOnlineRequest();
$saleResponse = $initialize->saleRequest($hash_in);

// Display Result 
echo ("Message: " . XMLParser::getNode($saleResponse,'message') . "<br>");
echo ("Vantiv eCommerce Transaction ID: " . XMLParser::getNode($saleResponse,'cnpTxnId'));
```

As of 8.13.1, you may also use a tree-oriented style to get the response values:
```php
<?php
require_once realpath(dirname(__FILE__)) . '/../lib/CnpOnline.php';  
    // Visa $10.00 sale
    $hash_in = array(
	      'amount'=>'106',
	      'orderId' => '123213',
	      'orderSource'=>'ecommerce',
	      'card'=>array(
	      'type'=>'VI',
	      'number' =>'4100000000000001',
	     'expDate' =>'1000')
	      );
//Perform the transaction on the Vantiv eCommerce Platform
$initialize = new CnpOnlineRequest($treeResponse=true);
$saleResponse = $initialize->saleRequest($hash_in);

// Display Result 
echo ("Message: " . $saleResponse->saleResponse->message . "<br>");
echo ("Vantiv eCommerce Transaction ID: " . $saleResponse->saleResponse->cnpTxnId);
```


NOTE: you may have to change the path to match that of your filesystems.  

If you get an error like:
```bash
PHP Fatal error:  require_once(): Failed opening required '/home/gdake/git/cnp-sdk-for-php/../lib/CnpOnline.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear:/usr/share/php') in /home/gdake/git/cnp-sdk-for-php/foo.php on line 2
```
You need to change the second line of your script to load the real location of CnpOnline.php

If you get an error like:
```bash
PHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required '/home/gdake/cnp-sdk-for-php/lib/../vendor/autoload.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /home/gdake/cnp-sdk-for-php/lib/CnpOnline.php on line 42
```
You probably had a problem with composer.  You can safely remove line 42 if you are not using batch processing, or you can edit it to point at our dependencies that you've downloaded in another way.

5) Next run this file using php on the command line or inside a browser. You should see the following result provided you have connectivity to the Vantiv eCommerce certification environment.  You will see an HTTP error if you don't have access to the Vantiv URL

    Message: Valid Format
    Vantiv eCommerce Transaction ID: <your-numeric-txn-id>
